Project Code: UNMD0007
Project Name: Maryland - State of the State
Prepared for: Candace Turitto, University of Maryland, College Park
Interviews: 500
Field Period: October 22, 2024 - October 29, 2024

YouGov interviewed 611 Maryland registered voters, with the goal of screening 
for and surveying likely voters in Maryland. The Maryland registered voters were 
then matched down to a sample of 529, yielding a target subsample of 500 MD 
likely voters. The respondents were matched to a sampling frame on gender, age, 
race, and education. The sampling frame is a politically representative "modeled 
frame" of Maryland registered voters, based upon the American Community Survey 
(ACS) public use microdata file, public voter file records, the 2020 Current 
Population Survey (CPS) Voting and Registration supplements, the 2020 National 
Election Pool (NEP) exit poll, and the 2020 CES surveys, including demographics 
and 2020 presidential vote.

The matched cases were weighted to the sampling frame using propensity scores. 
The matched cases and the frame were combined, and a logistic regression was 
estimated for inclusion in the frame. The propensity score function included age, 
gender, race/ethnicity, years of education, home ownership status, and 2020 
presidential vote choice. The propensity scores were grouped into deciles of the 
estimated propensity score in the frame, and then post-stratified according to 
these deciles.

The weights were then post-stratified on home ownership status and 2020 
presidential vote choice, as well as a four-way stratification of gender, 
age (4-categories), race (4-categories), and education (4-categories). 
The weighted dataset of MD registered voters was then subsetted on likely 
voters, and the weights were trimmed and recentered around 1, to produce the 
final weights for MD likely voters.
