# Step 1 clone
Start by cloning the repository. On Github Desktop go to the top left button labeled "current repository". Click the add drop down button, clone, then use the url to clone this repo. This should make a file on your computer labled Github, with a smaller folder in that called mdsenatepoll. 

# Step 2 make a new branch
On Github desktopm click the dropdown button next to current repository called "current branch". Create, name, and publish a new branch. Include your name and a question issue area on the branch name.

# Step 3 commit and push to the pollsq.rmd file
once you've made a new branch and published it, take your questions and type them into the pollsq.rmd file. Make sure your GitHub desktop says that your current branch is the one you just made. As you work feel free to committ and push, and when you're all finished move on to make a pull requests.

# Step 4 pull requests make yourself the assignee on a pr
When you are finished and want to submit all changes to the main branch create a pull request. Creating a pull request on Github desktop will open a web page to Github online. On the right side of the screen where it says "assignee" click to put yourself as the assignee. I can help merge the pr in our Github which will approve it for everyone to pull to their machines.
